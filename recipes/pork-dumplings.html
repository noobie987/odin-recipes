    <ul>
        <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root </li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil </li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.  </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Serve hot and enjoy!  </p>
