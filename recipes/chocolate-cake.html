    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
        
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Sugar</h3>
            <p>
            Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Flour</h3>
            <p> 
                All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps build the fluffy texture.
            </p>   
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cocoa Powder</h3>
            <p>
                Of course, you'll want to use Hershey's brand unsweetened cocoa powder for this one. It adds the rich, indulgent flavor you know and love. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Leaveners</h3>
            <p>
                Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means they cause the batter to expand and give the cake a perfect rise.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Salt</h3>
            <p>
                Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and highlight the other flavors. It might not seem like a lot, but you'll definitely miss the salt if you skip it. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Eggs</h3>
            <p>
                Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide structure, add moisture, lend flavor, and contribute to a tender texture.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Milk</h3>
            <p>
                Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Oil</h3>
            <p>
                Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Vanilla</h3>
            <p>
                Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring out the flavors of the other ingredients, such as the cocoa powder. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Boiling Water</h3>
            <p>
                You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of boiling water. It intensifies the chocolatey flavor, contributes to the fluffy texture, and reacts with the leaveners to create an even higher rise.   
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the Batter</h3>
           <p>
            Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand. 
           </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Bake the Cake</h3>
            <p>
                Pour the batter into two prepared cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Frost the Cake </h3>
            <p>
                While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the cake is completely cooled, top each layer with the frosting. Stack them and continue frosting until the cake is completely covered. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
